I am a Senior Data Scientist at [HighPeak AI](https://www.highpeak.ai/), where I develop advanced machine learning models to support health and financial decision-making. My work focuses on transforming complex, heterogeneous data into actionable insights that drive meaningful outcomes for users and organizations.

I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science & Engineering from The Ohio State University, with research expertise in visual analytics and text analysis. My academic work focused on developing innovative techniques for interactive knowledge discovery in complex, heterogeneous data environments. Currently, I apply these foundations to address challenges in health analytics and quantitative modeling. Beyond my current role, I’m expanding my expertise in financial systems, with a growing focus on data-driven strategies and risk modeling powered by advanced AI techniques.

When I’m not deep in model training or exploring the latest in LLM research, I’m usually spending time with my two besties—meet my cats—who are always ready to turn my keyboard into their personal lounge.
